| Service                          | <p>A configuration registered on the target device which you will use to access remote applications. The target device can have many services. There is a bulk service created by default and does not require entry of any service attributes. The bulk service provides the basis for a target device and enables scripting functionality.<br>Attributes of a service:<br>Application Type: The application mapped to this service i.e. SSH, VNC, RDP, HTTP/S<br>Port: The port on the target device which the application is listening<br>Service host address: Local network IP address or fully qualified domain name to host this service<br><br>Enabled: Whether or not the remote.it service is available for connections. You may want to disable this and enable it only when needed if you are concerned with bandwidth like on a cellular internet connection<br>Status: This is online/offline status of the remote.it service.</p> |
