# Overview

These methods of installation and registration only apply to devices which will serve as connection endpoints and NOT as connection initiators. Do not worry, we are working on the initiator feature.

These are the scenarios supported:

* [Registration with Pre-configured Services](registration-with-pre-configured-services.md): Devices which are the same hardware, software and service configuration that will be registered into your account.
* [Registration into a User's Account](registration-into-a-users-account.md): Devices which have the same hardware and OS architecture, but other installed software and service configurations may be different, but you wish to be registered into your account or another user's account \(other user's accounts can be different for each device\) - this may be the case for something like a jumpbox or router. In this case, the user will need to additionally setup services using the Desktop Application after registration.
