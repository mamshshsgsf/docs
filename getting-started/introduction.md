# Introduction

### What is remote.it?

remote.it allows you to make secure remote connections between two computers. Some of the benefits include:

* Crossing multiple NATs/firewalls
* Using a single TCP port
* **portforwardless:** without requiring port forwarding in the router, significantly reducing your network's vulnerability
* Many TCP-based protocols and applications are supported
  * SSH/SCP - [network console and file transfer](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/sections/360009162531-Remote-console-and-file-transfer)
  * VNC, RDP, Mac Screen Sharing - [remotely access the Graphical User Interface \(GUI\)](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/categories/360001173912-Applications)
  * http/https \(web servers and applications such as node-red\)
  * SMB \(Samba\) file sharing
  * other protocols supported under the "custom TCP" option, e.g. MQTT
