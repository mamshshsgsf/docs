# remote.it API

remote.it is powered by a robust set of APIs that allow you to do anything via an API that you can do with our [web portal](https://app.remote.it) or mobile applications.

Below are pages documenting our various APIs. It is best to start with the authentication docs since all other APIs require you to authenticate. It is also recommended to use the graphQL API where possible as it allows a flexible query that avoids multiple REST-API calls to only request the the data you need. Use the REST-API for connections and modifications to data.

We are in the process of adding more to our documentation website. If you have needs beyond the above APIs here, [please contact us](http://support.remot3.it).
