# Usage

Once remoteit has been installed on the target device and the services have been configured, then you can connect to any of the services using either the Desktop, CLI, [remoteit Web Portal](https://app.remote.it), or the API. The Desktop and CLI can support both peer to peer connections and proxy connections while the Web Portal and API can only support proxy connections.

For more on connections, please refer to the documentation for [Desktop](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360048935411-Connections), [remoteit Web Portal](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360048707812-The-Devices-Page) or the [API](../api-reference/usage/usage-examples.md).
