# Device Package

This package installs the remoteit target agent which is the lowest level of component required for connections. **With this package installed, other devices can connect to this one, but this one cannot initiate connections to others.** If this device needs to be able to initiate a connection to another one, you will need to install the CLI (if connections will be made via script or command line) or the Desktop Application (provides a straight forward UI to make connections and configure devices).

You can interact with remoteit to run network diagnostics and troubleshoot other issues with your device. Use this package when you are concerned with the disk space and processes footprint.
