# OS Images

An OS image is simply a file that contains the operating system, your executables, and any data files that might be related to your programs. remote.it provides these as an easy way to get started with the basic OS and our installation packages pre-installed to quickly get up and running.&#x20;

We currently provide images for Raspberry Pis but check back for new releases and operating systems.&#x20;
