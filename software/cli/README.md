# CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool that provides a consistent interface for interacting with remote.it on a given device. CLI commands are covered [here](../../developer-tools/cli-usage.md) including descriptions, syntax, and usage examples.

The remote.it Command Line Interface (CLI) is installed as part of the Desktop Application as well as the remote.it packages for various Linux distributions. This set of instructions is to install the CLI as a stand alone where the desktop application is not needed.&#x20;
