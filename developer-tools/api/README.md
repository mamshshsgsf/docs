# API

remote.it is powered by a robust set of APIs that allow you to do anything via an API that you can do with our [web portal](https://app.remote.it), desktop or mobile applications.

Below are pages documenting our graphQL API. It is best to start with the authentication docs since the API requires you to authenticate. GraphQL is a data query language for API's, developed by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. GraphQL provides an alternative to the REST API.
