# AWS AMI

## Overview

remote.it can be used in conjunction with AWS \(Amazon Web Services\) to create an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance that registers to your account and can only be accessed using remote.it. These Instances can then be used to allow you to access other Instances and Services using remote.it. In essence, the Instance will act as a gateway for you to access other Instances at Amazon.

Using remote.it also gives you the ability to configure your security group to completely block traffic from the outside, only allowing access to your Instance through remote.it. Keep in mind that remote.it uses Zero Trust/SASE architectures, and is therefore very secure. If the Instance is set-up according to the following specifications, the only way someone else would have access to your Instance is if you shared it with them through remote.it, or if they had access to your remote.it account.

Additionally, all of your Instances can be found on the remote.it Web Portal or Desktop App, meaning remote.it can function as a hub for all of your remote Instances and connections, even if your Instances are in different regions. This makes keeping track of all your Instances very convenient and easy, as they are all in one place.
