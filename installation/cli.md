# CLI

The remote.it Command Line Interface \(CLI\) is installed as part of the Desktop Application as well as the remote.it packages for various Linux distributions. This set of instructions is to install the CLI stand where the desktop application is not needed. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The remote.it CLI has slightly different behavior if you are running as a root user versus a non-root user. In general, you will want to always run as a root user.

* On Windows, you will need to open a "Command Prompt" as an Administrator and replace any example you see as `sudo remoteit` by `remoteit.exe`
* On Mac and Linux, you must run any commands related to creating/managing a Device or Services as a root user \(e.g. `sudo`\)
