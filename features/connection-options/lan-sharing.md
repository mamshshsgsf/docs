LAN (Local Area Network) sharing allows you to share a Remote.It peer to peer connection to a remote service with someone else on the same LAN where you are currently located.

Sharing a service across your local network is a great easy way to reduce time spent setting up additional machines and users with their own accounts. The share is done on a specific service and you can control who can access it. Either specifically to a single LAN address or to a range of IPs.

Secure it for your private network and hide from your guest network.&#x20;

With remote.it installed anywhere on the network you have the control to share it with specific IP, a range of IPs, or everyone on the LAN.&#x20;
