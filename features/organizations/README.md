# Organizations

{% hint style="info" %}
Coming in December 2021
{% endhint %}

For all levels of plans you can now create your own Organization and invite members to immediately collaborate and share all your devices. An Organization owner can purchase additional seats and assign them to members. This allows members to get access to all devices owned by the Organization.

## Create

The user who creates an Organization is the account that owns all the devices registered with remote.it&#x20;

Create is available in our desktop application for Linux, Windows, MacOS

## Manage Access

You can change the number of user licenses at any time to scale your team.

Invite Licensed members to have access to the complete device list.

Invite Unlicensed members to have access to the first 5 devices in the account.
